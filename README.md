I am really struggling to figure out how to get the task dashboard page to display the accordion pictures and have the collapse settings work properly. 
This was a cool project, I learned a lot doing it. My apologies for turning it in so late, I was trying to get things to work right, but at this point I'm a little stumped 
and it has been long enough. I think the idea for the website is pretty cool and has a lot of potential. I really loved learning that the type="file" paramter exists. 
That is insanely useful and seems really easy and simplistic. There are definitely some design things that could be dialed in better, but I wanted to turn this in and move on.
